The problems they face depend on the type of impairment and the severity of their disability. The term “disability” refers to how individuals interact with their environment. Disability social workers assist people in comprehending their diagnosis, and they support them in making lifestyle adjustments to accommodate their disability.\nWhat we do\nDevelopmental disability social workers assess their client’s strengths and needs in order to determine what kind of support systems are required to help them achieve their goals. When the assessment is complete, the social worker creates an individualized plan to support the disabled person and improve his sense of wellbeing. To secure the best programs to help the client, the disability social worker conducts research into community resources like governmental programs including Medicaid and food stamps. The social worker can then recommend programs that provide the suitable benefits and assist the clients in obtaining needed services.",
